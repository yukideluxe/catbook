CatBook powered by IronHack
===========================

Because cats, as social beings, also deserve a place to share their experiences.

Step by step implementation
---------------------------

1. ``rails new catbook``
2. Use rspec instead of minitest - [Rspec](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails)
3. Use factory_girl - [FactoryGirl](https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_girl_rails)
4. Use Postgres as default database - [Configuring a Database - Rails Guides](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html#configuring-a-database)
5. Basic cat model ``rails generate model cat``
6. Seed development database with fake data ``rake db:seed``
7. Bower and boostrap - [Bower](https://github.com/42dev/bower-rails)
8. Create basic scaffold for listing, editing and showing cats
  - Security pitfalls are on purpose included here in order the students to find them
  - Included kaminari pagination - [Kaminari](https://github.com/amatsuda/kaminari)
9. Introduce sightly advanced association ``FollowerRelation`` - [FrontMatter rails tutorial](https://www.railstutorial.org/book/frontmatter)
10. Do 'heavy' queries to render followers in cats#show and cats#index
11. Generate rake task to seed followers ``rails g task catbook seed_follower_relations`` (Note: Could have been also done in the seeds file? Is is better like this?)
